 * @file traffic-matrix.h
 * @brief Flow-level traffic demand generation for the mesh.
 *
 * @ref TrafficMatrix maintains a list of @ref Flow objects and updates
 * them each tick according to the configured traffic model. There are no
 * packets — a flow simply represents "node A wants X Mbps to node B."
 *
 *
 * **Traffic models**
 *
 * | @c model      | Flow creation                           | Per-tick update                          |
 * |---------------|-----------------------------------------|------------------------------------------|
 * | @c "constant" | All flows created at @ref Initialize.   | None; flows run for the full simulation. |
 * | @c "poisson"  | Initial flows at @ref Initialize, plus | New flows added; expired flows removed.  |
 * |               | Poisson arrivals each tick.             |                                          |
 * | @c "on_off"   | All flows created at @ref Initialize.   | ON/OFF state machine per flow.           |
 *
 * **Flow removal**
 * Expired flows (@c end_time_s > 0 and @c active == false) are erased from
 * @c m_flows each tick. Permanent flows (@c end_time_s == 0) are never removed,
 * even when they transition to inactive in the on-off model.
 *
 * **Gateway resolution**
 * For the @c "gateway" topology, @ref TrafficConfig::gateway_node_id is
 * resolved as a numeric index first (@c stoul); if that throws, it falls
 * back to a linear search by @ref NodeSpec::id string. Index 0 is used
 * when @c gateway_node_id is empty.
