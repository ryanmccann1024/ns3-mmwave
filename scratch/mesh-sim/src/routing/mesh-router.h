 * Produced by @ref MeshRouter::Route and consumed by @ref MetricsWriter,

 * **Effective demand**
 * @c demand_mbps reflects the flow's *effective* demand this tick — it is
 * zero when the flow is inactive or in the OFF phase of an on-off model,
 * regardless of the configured per-flow demand. Only the on_off model sets
 * @c in_on_phase to @c false; constant and Poisson flows always have
 * @c demand_mbps equal to @ref Flow::demand_mbps when active.
 *
 * **Unroutable flows**
 * When @c routable is @c false the path is empty, @c delivered_mbps is 0,
 * @c latency_ms is 0, and @c hop_count is 0. The @c src and @c dst fields
 * are always set.
 *
 * **Self-flows** (@c src == @c dst) are marked @c routable = @c true with an
 * empty path and zero delivered demand, since they require no forwarding.
