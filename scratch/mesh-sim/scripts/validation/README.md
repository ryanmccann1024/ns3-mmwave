@brief Module for comparing simulation results to arpo_data

Sim-vs-field comparison: runs mesh-sim across a directory of scenarios
(multi-seed), then overlays the pooled sim distribution against the ARPO
field traces as normalized histograms with a bootstrap CI band on the sim
curve, plus a two-sample K-S statistic and |Δmedian|/|Δmean| in the
chart subtitle and CSV.

**Scenario inputs** come from `inputs/custom/sherpa/spring_lake/` — one
subdirectory per scenario, each containing `run.ini` and `nodes.json`.
**Field traces** come from
`data/arpo_extracted/_plots/per_day/<scenario>/csvs/<src>/` and must be
generated up-front via `scripts.arpo_data.cli plot`.


## Run

From `scratch/mesh-sim/`:

```bash
# 1. Produce field trace CSVs (one-time per dataset; skip if already done)
python -m scripts.arpo_data.cli plot --all

# 2. Generate sim config files from calfex field data
python scripts/validation/build_config_files.py \
    -i data/arpo_extracted \
    -o inputs/calfex \
    -b sub-6 \
    -m node

# 3. Patch waypoints from GPS tracks into nodes.json
python -m scripts.validation.build_waypoints --all --time-mode scale --duration 60

# 4. Run the sim across all scenarios (default: 5 seeds each)
python -m scripts.validation.run_batch

# 5. Convert per-seed sim outputs to arpo_data-style trace CSVs
python -m scripts.validation.sim_to_traces outputs/<batch>

# 6. histogram overlay + bootstrap CI + K-S vs field
python -m scripts.validation.compare      outputs/<YYYY-MM>/<DD>/<HH-MM-SS>-validation

# 7. Cross-batch summary (overall + per-scenario)
python -m scripts.validation.compare_runs

# 8. Scenario fidelity audit (sim vs field layout / mobility)
python -m scripts.validation.scenario_fidelity outputs/<batch>
```

`build_config_files` reads the calfex GPS and silvus CSVs and writes
`nodes.json` and `run.ini` directly from field measurements. Channel
parameters come from `silvus/config.csv` on each IH node. Node starting
positions are the first GPS fix per node converted to local ENU metres
relative to the centroid of all nodes. Gateway name and traffic demand are
read from the sibling `calfex_sdwan/` directory; if not found both default
to safe placeholders. All IH nodes are written with `"mobility": "waypoint"`
and empty waypoints — always run `build_waypoints.py` afterwards before
invoking the sim.

## Regression suite

The small tracked manifest identifies the pre-change cases and reference hashes.
Full result snapshots are external artifacts, not source files. Ask the project
team for the approved cloud bundle and unpack the JSON references under
`tests/fixtures/regression/p0/`. Gzip archives and reference snapshots stay
untracked; never replace them by recapturing from changed code.

Once the references are installed, one command re-runs the cases against a
freshly built binary and compares their normalized results:

```bash
python3 -m scripts.validation.regression_check verify-suite \
    --sim-binary <BIN> \
    --manifest tests/fixtures/regression/p0/manifest.json \
    --out outputs/p0-regression/<name>
```

It validates the manifest and every snapshot hash *before* starting a simulator
process, then runs each case and prints one `PASS`/`FAIL`/`SKIP` row. Five
required cases have tracked inputs — three `baselines` scenarios, one CalFEX
sub-6 scenario, and the synthetic jammer smoke. One optional case uses the local
Sherpa Spring Lake data: when its recorded source files are absent the row is
`SKIP` and the console names the missing paths plus the action, "This
Sherpa/ARPO dataset is not included in Git. Ask the project team or data owner
for the approved inputs/custom/sherpa data." `--require-all` turns that
unavailable optional case into a failure. An optional case that is present but
changed, or that mismatches, always fails.

Suite output is disposable. `--out` must resolve beneath `outputs/` and may not
be `outputs/` itself. Reusing the same `--out` replaces only suite-owned
products — `suite-report.json` and the manifest-named case subdirectories —
leaving unrelated siblings alone. It never touches the tracked manifest or
local reference snapshots.

Exit codes: `0` all required (and executed optional) cases passed, `1` a
mismatch or failure, `2` a usage or I/O error.

Two related launcher notes: `run_batch` writes the launcher's captured
stdout/stderr to `console.log` beside the simulator's own `run.log`, and accepts
an optional `--band {mmwave,sub-6}` override; `build_config_files` writes
`[channel] band` into every generated `run.ini`.

Without reference data, `python3 -m scripts.validation.smoke_check --sim-binary
<BIN> --out outputs/smoke-check/<new-name>` checks the tiny synthetic jammer
scenario's output contracts and two-run same-seed repeatability. CI runs this
on Linux/macOS; it is not a comparison against historical cloud references.
`regression_snapshot.py` owns normalization/comparison; `regression_check.py`
owns the CLI/suite. Launcher paths and loader setup live in `scripts/sim_support.py`.

## How to read the chart

One axis: normalized histograms (densities) of sim and field samples,
overlaid. Density normalization (∫=1) lets the curves compare directly even
though sim N (tens of thousands) is much larger than field N. The shaded
band on the sim curve is a pointwise bootstrap CI (default 90%, B=1000).

Subtitle annotates the K-S D-statistic and |Δmedian|/|Δmean| in the metric's
units. K-S is unitless (0–1) — useful for ranking similarity across runs;
|Δmed| / |Δmean| are in the metric's own units. Median is the robust
central-tendency (skewed wireless metrics + bursty fades drag the mean
around); mean is reported alongside it so you can see when they diverge.

The K-S p-value is intentionally not reported: with N in the tens of
thousands per pool, p ≈ 0 even for operationally trivial differences.

| `build_config_files` | `inputs/calfex/nodes.json` + `inputs/calfex/run.ini`              |
| `run_batch`          | `outputs/.../<HH-MM-SS>-validation/<scenario>/seed-N/{links,mcs,rx-power}.csv` + `batch_manifest.json` |
| `sim_to_traces`      | `outputs/.../<scenario>/sim_traces/seed-N/csvs/<src>/bh2_<metric>__<src>_to_<peer>_trace.csv` |
| `compare`            | `outputs/.../<scenario>/validation/pngs/<src>/hist_<metric>__<src>_to_<peer>.png` + per-scenario `metrics.csv` + top-level `validation_summary.csv` |

Each figure plots sim density with a shaded pointwise bootstrap CI band
(default 90%, B=1000) and field density as a line; subtitle annotates K-S,
|Δmed|, and |Δmean|. The summary CSV has one row per (scenario, link, metric)
with means, medians, IQRs, sample counts, |Δmedians|, |Δmeans|, and K-S.

## Conventions

- **Distributional comparison, not temporal.** Sim and field samples are
  pooled raw (no smoothing, no time alignment). The comparison is over the
  marginal distribution of each metric.
- **MCS cap.** Sim MCS is post-capped at 12 to match the field firmware
  limit before any comparison is made.
- **Sim trace MAC columns are empty.** `sim_to_traces` leaves
  `tag_local_mac`, `tag_sta_mac`, and `tag_interface` blank — the sim has
  no per-antenna identity.
- **Scenario name mapping.** Sim names translate to field names by stripping
  `arpo-`, joining the middle tokens with `_`, and upper-casing
  single-letter family tokens:
  `arpo-1-x-misc-04172026` → `1-X_misc_04172026`.
- **NaN rows in `validation_summary.csv`** mean the field collect did not
  capture telemetry for that link (e.g. rab2 and rab3 were not beam-paired
  during the scenario). This is expected for some scenarios and is not a
  pipeline error.
- **`--auto-waypoints` mutates `inputs/`.** The patch is permanent for the
  duration of the run. Use `git diff inputs/` to review and
  `git checkout inputs/` to revert.
- **`build_waypoints` mobility classifier is bbox-based** (threshold: 20 m
  max bounding-box dimension). Path length alone is GPS-noise-prone and
  would misclassify jittery static nodes as mobile.
- **`build_config_files` writes empty waypoints.** Always run
  `build_waypoints.py` after `build_config_files.py` before running the sim.
